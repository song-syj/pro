;; Exercise 1.44: The idea of smoothing a function is an important
;; concept in signal processing. If f is a function and dx is some
;; small number, then the smoothed version of f is the function
;; whose value at a point x is the average of f (x âˆ’ dx), f (x),
;; and f (x +dx). Write a procedure smooth that takes as input a
;; procedure that computes f and returns a procedure that computes
;; the smoothed f . It is sometimes valuable to repeatedly smooth a
;; function (that is, smooth the smoothed function, and so on) to
;; obtain the n-fold smoothed function. Show how to generate the
;; n-fold smoothed function of any given function using smooth and
;; repeated from Exercise 1.43.
