;; Exercise 1.24: Modify the timed-prime-test procedure of
;; Exercise 1.22 to use fast-prime? (the Fermat method), and
;; test each of the 12 primes you found in that exercise. Since
;; the Fermat test has Î˜(log n) growth, how would you expect
;; the time to test primes near 1,000,000 to compare with the
;; time needed to test primes near 1000? Do your data bear
;; this out? Can you explain any discrepancy you find?
