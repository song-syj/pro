;; Exercise 2.3: Implement a representation for rectangles in
;; a plane. (Hint: You may want to make use of Exercise 2.2.) In
;; terms of your constructors and selectors, create procedures
;; that compute the perimeter and the area of a given rectan-
;; gle. Now implement a diï¬€erent representation for rectan-
;; gles. Can you design your system with suitable abstraction
;; barriers, so that the same perimeter and area procedures
;; will work using either representation?

;; To simplify things, we'll assume that the sides of the rectangle are to be perpendicular to the x- and y-axes of the coordinate plane.
