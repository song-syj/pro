;; Exercise 2.58: Suppose we want to modify the differentia-
;; tion program so that it works with ordinary mathematical
;; notation, in which + and * are infix rather than prefix opera-
;; tors. Since the differentiation program is defined in terms of
;; abstract data, we can modify it to work with different repre-
;; sentations of expressions solely by changing the predicates,
;; selectors, and constructors that define the representation of
;; the algebraic expressions on which the differentiator is to
;; operate.
;; a. Show how to do this in order to differentiate algebraic
;; expressions presented in infix form, such as (x + (3
;; * (x + (y + 2)))) . To simplify the task, assume that
;; + and * always take two arguments and that expres-
;; sions are fully parenthesized.
;; b. ÓÅâe problem becomes substantially harder if we allow
;; standard algebraic notation, such as (x + 3 * (x +
;; y + 2)) , which drops unnecessary parentheses and
;; assumes that multiplication is done before addition.
;; Can you design appropriate predicates, selectors, and
;; constructors for this notation such that our derivative
;; program still works?
