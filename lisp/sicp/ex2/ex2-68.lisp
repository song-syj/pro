;; Exercise 2.68: ÓÅâe encode procedure takes as arguments a
;; message and a tree and produces the list of bits that gives
;; the encoded message.
;; (define (encode message tree)
;; 	(if (null? message)
;; 		'()
;; 		(append (encode-symbol (car message) tree)
;; 				(encode (cdr message) tree))))
;; is a procedure, which you must write, that
;; returns the list of bits that encodes a given symbol accord-
;; ing to a given tree. You should design encode-symbol so
;; that it signals an error if the symbol is not in the tree at all.
;; Test your procedure by encoding the result you obtained in
;; Exercise 2.67 with the sample tree and seeing whether it is
;; the same as the original sample message.
