;; Exercise 2.57: Extend the differentiation program to han-
;; dle sums and products of arbitrary numbers of (two or more)
;; terms. ÓÅâen the last example above could be expressed as
;; (deriv '(* x y (+ x 3)) 'x)
;; Try to do this by changing only the representation for sums
;; and products, without changing the deriv procedure at all.
;; For example, the addend of a sum would be the first term,
;; and the augend would be the sum of the rest of the terms.

(defun augend (exp)
  (if (null (cdddr exp))
	  (caddr exp)
	  (cons '+ (cddr exp))))

(defun multiplicand (exp)
  (if (null (cdddr exp))
	  (caddr exp)
	  (cons '* (cddr exp))))
