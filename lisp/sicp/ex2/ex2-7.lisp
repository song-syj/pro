;; Exercise 2.7: Alyssaâ€™s program is incomplete because she
;; has not specified the implementation of the interval ab-
;; straction. Here is a definition of the interval constructor:
;; (define (make-interval a b) (cons a b))
;; Define selectors upper-bound and lower-bound to complete
;; the implementation.

(defun make-interval (a b) (cons a b))
(defun upper-bound (x) (cdr x))
(defun lower-bound (x) (car x))
