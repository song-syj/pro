;; Exercise 2.64: The following procedure list->tree con-
;; verts an ordered list to a balanced binary tree. The helper
;; procedure partial-tree takes as arguments an integer n
;; and list of at least n elements and constructs a balanced
;; tree containing the first n elements of the list. The result re-
;; turned by partial-tree is a pair (formed with cons ) whose
;; car is the constructed tree and whose cdr is the list of ele-
;; ments not included in the tree.
;; (define (list->tree elements)
;; 	(car (partial-tree elements (length elements))))

;; (define (partial-tree elts n)
;; 	(if (= n 0)
;; 		(cons '() elts)
;; 		(let ((left-size (quotient (- n 1) 2)))
;; 		  (let ((left-result
;; 				 (partial-tree elts left-size)))
;; 			(let ((left-tree (car left-result))
;; 				  (non-left-elts (cdr left-result))
;; 				  (right-size (- n (+ left-size 1))))
;; 			  (let ((this-entry (car non-left-elts))
;; 					(right-result
;; 					 (partial-tree
;; 					  (cdr non-left-elts)
;; 					  right-size)))
;; 				(let ((right-tree (car right-result))
;; 					  (remaining-elts
;; 					   (cdr right-result)))
;; 				  (cons (make-tree this-entry
;; 								   left-tree
;; 								   right-tree)
;; 						remaining-elts))))))))

;; a. Write a short paragraph explaining as clearly as you
;; can how partial-tree works. Draw the tree produced
;; by list->tree for the list (1 3 5 7 9 11) .
;; b. What is the order of growth in the number of steps re-
;; quired by list->tree to convert a list of n elements?
