The program is just a test for ttyS1.

you can hit the command "make" to compile
the program and generate the execute file
call "UART".And the program is executed by
a command "./UART 'number'".The number in-
dicate the device that is used for commun-
ication.For example "./UART 1" means using
the ttyS1 for communication.

The  step above generate the execute file
that runs in the arm linux.If you need a
program for linux ,just modify the Makefile
and let CC = gcc in the content.And make
again.
